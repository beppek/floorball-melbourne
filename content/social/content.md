There are currently 3 venues in Melbourne where you can play social floorball: Glen Iris, Sunshine and Officer. Don't worry if you don't have a stick, there's always someone that will let you borrow one.

### Glen Iris
Very nice venue with boards and full size goals with goalies. We generally swap the teams around a few times per session and keep the games fun. Men and women welcome. 

**Day**: Mondays

**Time**: 7:30pm - 9:30pm 

**Address**: 172 Burke Rd, Glen Iris

**Price**: $10 Full Price | $8 Concession | $0 Goalies | First time free | You can also pre-pay for the whole term if you will go to most sessions and save a few bucks.

**How to get here**: Easiest way to get here is by car, just follow the GPS to the address and drive through the gates to Sacre Coeur catholic school. Keep to the right in all the forks to get around to the back of the building. The gym is on the far side of the main building. If you are coming by public transport you will need to walk for a little bit. But don't be afraid to ask the other players if anyone is driving past your place and maybe you can hitch a ride next time.

### Sunshine
Full size court without boards. Small goals. Bring both a black and white shirt so we can make teams. We stick to the same teams through the session and keep the score on the big clock, making for a bit of (mostly) friendly competition. Men and women welcome.

**Day**: Tuesdays

**Time**: 7:00pm - 8:30pm

**Address**: 39 Lily St, Braybrook VIC 3019 (RecWest Braybrook)

**Price**: The price varies depending on the number of players, but generally costs about $8

**How to get here**: Make your way to RecWest Braybrook, go through to the front desk and ask for the floorball guys and they will point you in the direction. You don't need to pay anything at the front desk - if you see some people do that it's the basketball players that play on the other courts, so don't sweat.

### Officer
Open to all players of any ability. New teams are made each session and no scores are kept. Men and women welcome.

**Day**: Tuesdays

**Time**: 7:45pm - 9:30pm

**Address**: 2 Parker St, Officer VIC 3809 (Officer Community Hub)

**Price**: $5

**How to get here**: Best is to go by car. This is in woop woop.
