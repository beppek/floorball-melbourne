If you feel like playing some competitive floorball you can do so in Officer. There is a competitive men's league with 4 teams that play on Sundays, fortnightly. There is also a competitive game for women, with 2 teams squaring off against each other on the same day as the men's teams.

The men's teams are the following: [United FC](https://fcunited.com.au), Penguins, Royals and Eagles. The women's teams vary from time to time. The initiative is still new and we're hoping to grow the sport in Victoria and attract more players and potentially add more venues (Glen Iris is a first possible expansion).

You can find out more information about the league here: [http://www.pakenhamfloorball.org.au/Getting-Involved/elite-series.php](http://www.pakenhamfloorball.org.au/Getting-Involved/elite-series.php)
